As a developer in today’s rapidly evolving and constantly surprising AI landscape, it’s become critical to know how to leverage multiagent simulations and generative models. This course is designed to meet the burgeoning demand for AI professionals skilled in these domains. Join instructor Nayan Saxena for a comprehensive exploration of the process of building and running dynamic and interactive multiagent simulations using LangChain, the popular AI-powered framework. Get the skills you need to start building your first generative agents, equipping them with tools, and modeling complex generative agent scenarios. Along the way, test out your new technical know-how in the exercise challenges at the end of each section.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
